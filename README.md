# ghost_host
A shitty little client-server program I made so I can use my keyboard on my ps4 running linux without having to keep on plugging and plugging my keyboard

Notes:
I wouldn't use this to type out anything important like passwords or goverment secrets, I don't know the first thing about network security
I couldn't install pyautogui on my ps4 running gentoo so I compiled the client using pyinstaller on my other computer, I've had pretty good sucess with this.

Dependecies:
pyautogui
socket
getkey


DONT EVER USE THIS, I DIDNT KNOW WHAT SSH WAS WHEN I MADE THIS, USE SSH INSTEAD
